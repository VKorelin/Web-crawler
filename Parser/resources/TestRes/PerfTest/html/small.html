<h2><span lang=EN-US>1. THE BOY WHO LIVED</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four,
Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very
much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange
or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm
called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any
neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and
blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful
as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion
there was no finer boy anywhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Dursleys had everything they wanted,
but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the
Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several
years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her
sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible
to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the
Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small
son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like
that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the
dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky
outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening
all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie
for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>None of them noticed a large, tawny owl
flutter past the window.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up
his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good
bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal
at the walls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he
left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It was on the corner of the street that he
noticed the first sign of something peculiar—a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen—then he jerked his head around to
look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but
there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have
been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared
back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the
cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive—no, <i>looking</i> 
at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a
little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he
thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that
day.</span></p>
