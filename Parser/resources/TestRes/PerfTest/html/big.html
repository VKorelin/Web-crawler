<h2><span lang=EN-US>1. THE BOY WHO LIVED</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four,
Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very
much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange
or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm
called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any
neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and
blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful
as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion
there was no finer boy anywhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Dursleys had everything they wanted,
but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the
Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several
years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her
sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible
to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the
Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small
son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like
that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the
dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky
outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening
all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie
for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>None of them noticed a large, tawny owl
flutter past the window.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up
his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good
bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal
at the walls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he
left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It was on the corner of the street that he
noticed the first sign of something peculiar—a cat reading a map. For a second,
Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen—then he jerked his head around to
look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but
there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have
been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared
back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the
cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive—no, <i>looking</i> 
at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a
little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he
thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that
day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But on the edge of town, drills were driven
out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam,
he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed
people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in
funny clothes—the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some
stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes
fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering
excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them
weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an
emerald green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this
was probably some silly stunt—these people were obviously collecting for
something… yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later,
Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the
window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it
harder to concentrate on drills that morning. <i>He</i>  didn’t see the owls
swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they
pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had
never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several
important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until
lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to
buy himself a bun from the bakery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He’d forgotten all about the people in
cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them
angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch
were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It
was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he
caught a few words of what they were saying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I
heard—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“—yes, their son, Harry—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him.
He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but
thought better of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He dashed back across the road, hurried up
to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his
telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his
mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking… no, he
was being stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were
lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it,
he wasn’t even sure his nephew <i>was</i>  called Harry. He’d never even seen
the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying
Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t
blame her—if <i>he’d</i>  had a sister like that… but all the same, those
people in cloaks…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He found it a lot harder to concentrate on
drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, he was
still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man
stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that
the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost
knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he
said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear
sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at
last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around
the middle and walked off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He
had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a
Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off
for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before,
because he didn’t approve of imagination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As he pulled into the driveway of number
four, the first thing he saw—and it didn’t improve his mood—was the tabby cat
he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure
it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a
stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull
himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to
mention anything to his wife.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day.
She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act
normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time
to catch the last report on the evening news:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“And finally, bird watchers everywhere have
reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight,
there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction
since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed
their sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most
mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any
more showers of owls tonight, Jim?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t
know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to
tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour
of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night
early—it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair.
Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in
cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mrs. Dursley came into the living room
carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He
cleared his throat nervously. “Er—Petunia, dear—you haven’t heard from your
sister lately, have you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked
shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley
mumbled. “Owls… shooting stars… and there were a lot of funny looking people in
town today…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US>“So?”</span></i><span lang=EN-US> 
snapped Mrs. Dursley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Well, I just thought… maybe… it was
something to do with… you know… <i>her</i>  crowd.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed
lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name
“Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could,
“Their son—he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart
sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He didn’t say another word on the subject
as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr.
Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The
cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting
for something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Was he imagining things? Could all this
have anything to do with the Potters? If it did… if it got out that they were
related to a pair of—well, he didn’t think he could bear it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley
fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.
His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters
<i>were</i>  involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.
Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and
their kind… He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything
that might be going on—he yawned and turned over—it couldn’t affect <i>them…</i>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>How very wrong he was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into
an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on
the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door
slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was
nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A man appeared on the corner the cat had
been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just
popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Nothing like this man had ever been seen on
Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his
hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was
wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high heeled,
buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half moon
spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken
at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize
that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his
boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something.
But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly
at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street.
For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and
muttered, “I should have known.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He found what he was looking for in his
inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open,
held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a
little pop. He clicked it again—the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve
times he clicked the Put Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street
were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady eyed Mrs. Dursley,
they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement.
Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the
street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He
didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Fancy seeing you here, Professor
McGonagall.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had
gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing
square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its
eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn
into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“How did you know it was me?” she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat
sit so stiffly.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a
brick wall all day,” said Professor McGonagall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“All day? When you could have been
celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all
right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but
no—even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their news.”
She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living room window. “I heard it.
Flocks of owls… shooting stars… Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were
bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent—I’ll bet that was
Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore
gently. “We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall
irritably. “But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright
careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle
clothes, swapping rumors.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She threw a sharp, sideways glance at
Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he
didn’t, so she went on. “A fine thing it would be if, on the very day
You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us
all. I suppose he really <i>has</i>  gone, Dumbledore?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore.
“We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“A <i>what?”</i> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle
sweet I’m rather fond of.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall
coldly, as though she didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I
say, even if You-Know-Who <i>has</i>  gone—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“My dear Professor, surely a sensible
person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’
nonsense—for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by
his proper name: <i>Voldemort.”</i>  Professor McGonagall flinched, but
Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all
gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I know you haven’t”, said Professor
McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different.
Everyone knows you’re the only one You Know—oh, all right, <i>Voldemort,</i> 
was frightened of.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly.
“Voldemort had powers I will never have.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Only because you’re too—well—<i>noble</i> 
to use them.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so
much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at
Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the <i>rumors</i>  that are
flying around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared?
About what finally stopped him?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It seemed that Professor McGonagall had
reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been
waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had
she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain
that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going to believe it until
Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another
lemon drop and did not answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“What they’re<i>saying,”</i>  she pressed
on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find
the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are—are—that they’re—<i>dead.”</i>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor
McGonagall gasped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Lily and James… I can’t believe it… I
didn’t want to believe it… Oh, Albus…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dumbledore reached out and patted her on
the shoulder. “I know… I know…” he said heavily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as
she went on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potter’s son,
Harry. But—he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or
how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s
power somehow broke—and that’s why he’s gone.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dumbledore nodded glumly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“It’s—it’s <i>true?”</i>  faltered
Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done… all the people he’s killed… he
couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding… of all the things to stop
him… but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We
may never know.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace
handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a
great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a
very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets
were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though,
because he put it back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was
he who told you I’d be here, by the way?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I
don’t suppose you’re going to tell me <i>why</i>  you’re here, of all places?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and
uncle. They’re the only family he has left now.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“You don’t mean—you <i>can’t</i>  mean the
people who live <i>here?”</i>  cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet
and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore—you can’t. I’ve been watching them all
day. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this
son—I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for
sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“It’s the best place for him,” said
Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to
him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly,
sitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain
all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous—a
legend—I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the
future—there will be books written about Harry—every child in our world will
know his name!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very
seriously over the top of his half moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn
any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he
won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up
away from all that until he’s ready to take it?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Professor McGonagall opened her mouth,
changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes—yes, you’re right, of course.
But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as
though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Hagrid’s bringing him.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“You think it—<i>wise</i> —to trust Hagrid
with something as important as this?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said
Dumbledore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the
right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s
not careless. He does tend to—what was that?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A low rumbling sound had broken the silence
around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for
some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the
sky—and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front
of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing
to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and
at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so <i>wild</i>
—long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands
the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby
dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding
relieved. “At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,”
said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young
Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“No problems, were there?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“No, sir—house was almost destroyed, but I
got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell
asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent
forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast
asleep. Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a
curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Is that where—?” whispered Professor
McGonagall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that
scar forever.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Couldn’t you do something about it,
Dumbledore?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can
come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of
the London Underground. Well—give him here, Hagrid—we’d better get this over
with.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and
turned toward the Dursleys’ house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Could I—could I say good bye to him, sir?”
asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must
have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl
like a wounded dog.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall,
“you’ll wake the Muggles!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a
large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand
it—Lily an’ James dead—an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a
grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered,
patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden
wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a
letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back
to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the
little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked
furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes
seemed to have gone out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s
that. We’ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled
voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sirius his bike back. G’night, Professor
McGonagall—Professor Dumbledore, sir.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket
sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into
life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor
McGonagall,” said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her
nose in reply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dumbledore turned and walked back down the
street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked
it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that
Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking
around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle
of blankets on the step of number four.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned
on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet
Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you
would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his
blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and
he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing
he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened
the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next
few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley… He couldn’t know that
at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding
up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter—the boy who
lived!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>2. THE VANISHING GLASS</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Nearly ten years had passed since the
Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive
had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit
up the brass number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into their
living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when
Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten
years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink
beach ball wearing different colored bonnets—but Dudley Dursley was no longer a
baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first
bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father,
being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that
another boy lived in the house, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at
the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill
voice that made the first noise of the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Up! Get up! Now!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on
the door again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her
walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on
the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been
having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He
had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>His aunt was back outside the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Are you up yet?” she demanded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Nearly,” said Harry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Well, get a move on, I want you to look
after the bacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on
Duddy’s birthday.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Harry groaned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“What did you say?” his aunt snapped
through the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Nothing, nothing…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dudley’s birthday—how could he have
forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found
a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on.
Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of
them, and that was where he slept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When he was dressed he went down the hall
into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday
presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not
to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted
a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated
exercise—unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite
punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it,
but he was very fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Perhaps it had something to do with living
in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He
looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear
were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he
was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes.
He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all
the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about
his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a
bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first
question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“In the car crash when your parents died,”
she had said. “And don’t ask questions.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US>Don’t ask questions</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> —that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry
was turning over the bacon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a
morning greeting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over
the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must
have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but
it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way—all over the place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley
arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon.
He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick
blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said
that Dudley looked like a baby angel—Harry often said that Dudley looked like a
pig in a wig.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on
the table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile,
was counting his presents. His face fell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Thirty six,” he said, looking up at his
mother and father. “That’s two less than last year.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie
Marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“All right, thirty seven then,” said
Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum
coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley
turned the table over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too,
because she said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another <i>two</i>  presents while
we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? <i>Two</i>  more presents. Is that all
right?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like
hard work. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty … thirty…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Thirty nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed
the nearest parcel. “All right then.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Uncle Vernon chuckled. “Little tyke wants
his money’s worth, just like his father. ’Atta boy, Dudley!” He ruffled
Dudley’s hair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt
Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap
the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new
computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when
Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s
broken her leg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but
Harry’s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took
him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or
the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady
who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of
cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever
owned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking
furiously at Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel
sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded
himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr.
Paws, and Tufty again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon
suggested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the
boy.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like
this, as though he wasn’t there—or rather, as though he was something very
nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“What about what’s her name, your
friend—Yvonne?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt
Petunia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“You could just leave me here,” Harry put
in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change
and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just
swallowed a lemon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“And come back and find the house in
ruins?” she snarled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry,
but they weren’t listening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,”
said Aunt Petunia slowly, “…and leave him in the car…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it
alone…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he
wasn’t really crying—it had been years since he’d really cried—but he knew that
if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he
wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t
let him spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I… don’t… want… him… t-t-to come!” Dudley
yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot
Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother’s arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Just then, the doorbell rang—“Oh, good
Lord, they’re here!” said Aunt Petunia frantically—and a moment later, Dudley’s
best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy
with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind
their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t
believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and
Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and
uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before
they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his
large purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy—any
funny business, anything at all—and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until
Christmas.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry,
“honestly…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one
ever did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The problem was, strange things often
happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t
make them happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming
back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair
of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his
bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself
silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day,
where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next
morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been
before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his
cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he <i>couldn’t</i> 
explain how it had grown back so quickly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying
to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff
balls)—The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to
become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly
wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash
and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>On the other hand, he’d gotten into
terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s
gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone
else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very
angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing
school buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon
through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans
outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in
mid-jump.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But today, nothing was going to go wrong.
It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere
that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage smelling living room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to
Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the
council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects.
This morning, it was motorcycles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“…roaring along like maniacs, the young
hoodlums,” he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said
Harry, remembering suddenly. “It was flying.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in
front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a
gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dudley and Piers sniggered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was
only a dream.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If
there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it
was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it
was in a dream or even a cartoon—they seemed to think he might get dangerous
ideas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo
was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate
ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had
asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a
cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they
watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except
that it wasn’t blond.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Harry had the best morning he’d had in a
long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that
Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime,
wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo
restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory
didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and
Harry was allowed to finish the first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Harry felt, afterward, that he should have
known it was all too good to last.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>After lunch they went to the reptile house.
It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the
glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits
of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and
thick, man crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the
place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and
crushed it into a trash can—but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In
fact, it was fast asleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against
the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Make it move,” he whined at his father.
Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon
rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He
shuffled away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked
intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of
boredom itself—no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the
glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as
a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake
you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes.
Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with
Harry’s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US>It winked.</span></i><span lang=EN-US> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around
to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and
winked, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle
Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look
that said quite plainly:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US>“I get that all the time.”</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass,
though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The snake nodded vigorously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign
next to the glass. Harry peered at it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Boa Constrictor,
Brazil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Was it nice there?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the
sign again and Harry read on: <i>This specimen was bred in the zoo.</i>  “Oh, I
see—so you’ve never been to Brazil?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As the snake shook its head, a deafening
shout behind Harry made both of them jump.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS
SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as
he could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching
Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor.
What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened—one second, Piers
and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt
back with howls of horror.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of
the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself
rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house
screamed and started running for the exits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry
could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come… Thanksss,
amigo.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The keeper of the reptile house was in
shock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did
the glass go?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia
a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and
Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done
anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time
they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had
nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him
to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough
to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely
out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly
speak. He managed to say, “Go—cupboard—stay—no meals,” before he collapsed into
a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later,
wishing he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure
the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the
kitchen for some food.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten
years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been
a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember being
in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory
during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding
flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was
the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He
couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about
them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no
photographs of them in the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed
and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never
happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe
hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers
they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out
shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew
the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.
A wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on
a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in
the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest
thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry
tried to get a closer look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew
that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and
broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>3. THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor
earned Harry his longest ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his
cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken
his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out
on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on
her crutches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Harry was glad school was over, but there
was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers,
Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the
biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all
quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This was why Harry spent as much time as
possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the
holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would
be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he
wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private
school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand,
was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was
very funny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet
the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor
toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it—it might be sick.”
Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley
to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg
wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of
her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry
watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though
she’d had it for several years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That evening, Dudley paraded around the
living room for the family in his brand new uniform. Smeltings’ boys wore
maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters.
They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the
teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As he looked at Dudley in his new
knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of
his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was
her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown up. Harry didn’t trust
himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from
trying not to laugh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h6><span lang=EN-US>* * *</span></h6>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was a horrible smell in the kitchen
the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from
a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what
looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her
lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Your new school uniform,” she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Harry looked in the bowl again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to
be so wet.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of
Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when
I’ve finished.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to
argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going
to look on his first day at Stonewall High—like he was wearing bits of old
elephant skin, probably.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses
because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his
newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried
everywhere, on the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on
the doormat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his
paper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Make Harry get it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Get the mail, Harry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Make Dudley get it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail.
Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge,
who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a
bill, and—<i>a letter for Harry.</i>  Harry picked it up and stared at it, his
heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had
written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives—he didn’t
belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back.
Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Mr. H. Potter</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>The Cupboard under the Stairs</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>4 Privet Drive</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Little Whinging</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Surrey</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish
parchment, and the address was written in emerald green ink. There was no
stamp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a
purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake
surrounding a large letter <i>H.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen.
“What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter.
He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to
open the yellow envelope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and
flipped over the postcard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny
whelk.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was
written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply
out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s <i>mine!”</i>  said Harry, trying to snatch it back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the
letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green
faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds
it was the grayish white of old porridge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon
held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the
first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her
throat and made a choking noise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Vernon! Oh my goodness—Vernon!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that
Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored.
He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“I</i>  want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s <i>mine.”</i>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the
letter back inside its envelope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry didn’t move.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Let <i>me</i>  see it!” demanded Dudley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and
Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the
kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent
fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses
dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between
door and floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice,
“look at the address—how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t
think they’re watching the house?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Watching—spying—might be following us,” muttered Uncle
Vernon wildly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell
them we don’t want—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up
and down the kitchen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t
get an answer… Yes, that’s best… we won’t do anything…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear
when we took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did
something he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had
squeezed through the door. “Who’s writing to me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No one. it was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle
Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It was <i>not</i>  a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had
my cupboard on it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell
from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a
smile, which looked quite painful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Er—yes, Harry—about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have
been thinking… you’re really getting a bit big for it… we think it might be
nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why?” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff
upstairs, now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon
and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one
where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that
wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to
move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed
and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month old
video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven
over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first ever
television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had
been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that
Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with
the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books.
They were the only things in the room that looked as though they’d never been
touched.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his
mother, “I don’t <i>want</i>  him in there… I <i>need</i>  that room… make him
get out…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d
have given anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard
with that letter than up here without it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley
was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been
sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the
greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking
about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the
hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying
to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things
with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s
another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive—’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and
ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley
to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact
that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute
of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick,
Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched
in his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Go to your cupboard—I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at
Harry. “Dudley—go—just go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he
had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his
first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure
they didn’t fail. He had a plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next
morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the
Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet
Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept
across the dark hall toward the front door—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“AAAAARRRGH!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and
squashy on the doormat—something <i>alive!</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized
that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had
been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure
that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry
for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry
shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail
had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters
addressed in green ink.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I want—” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters
into pieces before his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home
and nailed up the mail slot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of
nails, “if they can’t <i>deliver</i>  them they’ll just give up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia,
they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with
the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As
they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door,
slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in
the downstairs bathroom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the
letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the
front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the
Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small noises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty four
letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside
each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt
Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious
telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to
complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who on earth wants to talk to <i>you</i>  this badly?”
Dudley asked Harry in amazement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<h6>* * *</h6>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast
table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he
spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke
and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters
came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry
leapt into the air trying to catch one—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Out! OUT!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him
into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over
their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters
still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly
but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all
back here in five minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some
clothes. No arguments!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that
no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the
boarded up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was
sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding
them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports
bag.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare
ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp
turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shake ’em off… shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he
did this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall
Dudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry,
he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so
long without blowing up an alien on his computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel
on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds
and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the
windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast
for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel
came over to their table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got
about an ’undred of these at the front desk.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She held up a letter so they could read the green ink
address:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Mr. H. Potter</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Room 17</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Railview Hotel</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Cokeworth</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked
his hand out of the way. The woman stared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and
following her from the dining room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<h6>* * *</h6>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia
suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly
what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a
forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off
they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field,
halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking
garage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia
dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them
all inside the car, and disappeared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car.
Dud ley sniveled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on
tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a <i>television.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it <i>was</i> 
Monday—and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because
of television—then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course,
his birthdays were never exactly fun—last year, the Dursleys had given him a
coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven
every day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also
carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked
what he’d bought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing
at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was
the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there
was no television in there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully,
clapping his hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his
boat!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with
a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so
all aboard!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept
down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like
hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the
way to the broken down house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the
wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp
and empty. There were only two rooms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each
and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked
and shriveled up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said
cheerfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody
stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry
privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray
from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled
the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room
and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went
off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of
floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went
on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get
comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by
the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of
Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist,
told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday
tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where
the letter writer was now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He
hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.
Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters
when they got back that he’d be able to steal one somehow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the
rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise?
Was the rock crumbling into the sea?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds… twenty…
ten… nine—maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him—three… two… one…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BOOM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring
at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>4. THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. “Where’s the
cannon?” he said stupidly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding
into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands—now they knew what had been
in the long, thin package he had brought with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you—I’m armed!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a pause. Then—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SMASH!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its
hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was
almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled
beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all
the hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that
his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted
it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little.
He turned to look at them all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an
easy journey…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with
fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was
crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw
that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant.
“Yeh look a lot like yet dad, but yeh’ve got yet mom’s eyes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are
breaking and entering!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he
reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands,
bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it
into a corner of the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being
trodden on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Anyway—Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the
Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here—I mighta sat
on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a
slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a
large, sticky chocolate cake with <i>Happy Birthday Harry</i>  written on it in
green icing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but
the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who
are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The giant chuckled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of
Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands
together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip
bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see
what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring
fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt
the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his
weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a
copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several
chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before
starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling
sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the
first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a
little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The giant chuckled darkly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore,
Dursley, don’ worry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had
never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the
giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m
sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the
back of his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told
yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts—yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Er—no,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid looked shocked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Sorry?”</i>  barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the
Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’ s them as should be sorry! I
knew yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know
abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents
learned it all?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All what?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the
whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that
this boy—this boy!—knows nothin’ abou’—about ANYTHING?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to
school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I know <i>some</i>  things,” he said. “I can, you know, do
math and stuff.” But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I
mean. <i>Your</i>  world. <i>My</i>  world. <i>Yer parents’ world.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What world?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“DURSLEY!” he boomed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something
that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But yeh must know about yet mom and dad,” he said. “I mean,
they’re <i>famous.</i>  You’re <i>famous.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What? My—my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeh don’ know… yeh don’ know…” Hagrid ran his fingers
through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeh don’ know what yeh <i>are?”</i>  he said finally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sit! I forbid you
to tell the boy anything!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under
the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable
trembled with rage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter
Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’
you’ve kept it from him all these years?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Kept <i>what</i>  from me?” said Harry eagerly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid.
“Harry—yer a wizard.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the
whistling wind could be heard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m a <i>what?”</i>  gasped Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the
sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once
yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would
yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish
envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut on the
Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Dear Mr. Potter,</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>We are pleased to inform you that
you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please
find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Term begins on September 1. We await

<p class=MsoNormal>Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he
couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What
does it mean, they await my owl?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping
a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from
yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl—a real, live, rather
ruffled looking owl—a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue
between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Dear Professor Dumbledore,</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Given Harry his letter.</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Taking him to buy his things
tomorrow.</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re
well.</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Hagrid</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped
it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he
came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the
telephone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle
Vernon, still ashen faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s not going,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid grunted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A what?” said Harry, interested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk
like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest
Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that
rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You knew?” said Harry. “You <i>knew</i>  I’m a—a wizard?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. <i>“Knew!</i>  Of
course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh,
she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that—that <i>school</i>
—and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning
teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was—a freak! But
for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were
proud of having a witch in the family!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on.
It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got
married and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as
strange, just as—as—<i>abnormal</i> —and then, if you please, she went and got
herself blown up and we got landed with you!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he
said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the
Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’
James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own
story when every kid in our world knows his name!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly
anxious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice.
“I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of
yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person
ter tell yeh—but someone’s gotta—yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh—mind, I
can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and
then said, “It begins, I suppose, with—with a person called—but it’s incredible
yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well—I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one
does.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why not?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey,
this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went… bad. As bad as you
could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah can’t spell it. All right—<i>Voldemort.”</i>  Hagrid
shuddered. “Don’t make me say it again. Anyway, this—this wizard, about twenty
years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too—some were afraid,
some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was gettin’ himself power, all
right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly
with strange wizards or witches… terrible things happened. He was takin’ over.
’Course, some stood up to him—an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only safe
places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was
afraid of. Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I
ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is
why You-Know-Who never tried to get ’em on his side before… probably knew they
were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em… maybe he just
wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village
where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old.
He came ter yer house an’—an’—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted
handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad—knew yer mum an’ dad,
an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find—anyway…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then—an’ this is the real
myst’ry of the thing—he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of
it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it.
Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut.
That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh—took care of yer
mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even—but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer
famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ‘em, no one except
you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age—the
McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts—an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As
Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light,
more clearly than he had ever remembered it before—and he remembered something
else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid was watching him sadly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s
orders. Brought yeh ter this lot…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had
almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to
have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were
clenched.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s
something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have
cured—and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no
denying it, and the world’s better off without them in my opinion—asked for all
they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types—just what I expected,
always knew they’d come to a sticky end—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a
battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like
a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley—I’m warning you—one more word…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a
bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself
against the wall and fell silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting
back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But what happened to Vol—, sorry—I mean, You-Know-Who?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he
tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry,
see… he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful—why’d he go?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he
had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his
time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter
ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if
he was comin’ back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost
his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him,
Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on—<i>I</i> 
dunno what it was, no one does—but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in
his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure
there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be?
He’d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and
Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty
toads every time they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once
defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been
able to kick him around like a football?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a
mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was
scared or angry?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it…
every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had
happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry… chased by Dudley’s gang, he
had somehow found himself out of their reach… dreading going to school with
that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back… and the very last
time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he
was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid
was positively beaming at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard—you wait,
you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going
to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he
needs all sorts of rubbish—spell books and wands and—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop
him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer
mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest
school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t
know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll
be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM
MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella
and whirled it over his head, “NEVER,” he thundered,
“—INSULT—ALBUS—DUMBLEDORE—IN—FRONT—OF—ME!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to
point at Dudley—there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker,
a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his
hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on
them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into
the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door
behind them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it
didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much
like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at
Hogwarts,” he said. “I’m—er—not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was
allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff—one o’
the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, well—I was at Hogwarts meself but I—er—got expelled,
ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’
everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man,
Dumbledore.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why were you expelled?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said
Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles
a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in one o’ the pockets.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>5. DIAGON ALLEY</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it
was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It was a dream, he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant
called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open
my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door,</i>  Harry
thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such
a good dream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was
full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the
collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a
newspaper held in its beak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a
large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and
jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid,
who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack
Hagrid’s coat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t do that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped
its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the
pockets.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing <i>but</i> 
pockets—bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs,
teabags… finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Knuts?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The little bronze ones.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held
out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it.
Then he flew off through the open window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter
London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them.
He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon
inside him had got a puncture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Um—Hagrid?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I haven’t got any money—and you heard Uncle Vernon last
night… he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and
scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But if their house was destroyed—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first
stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad
cold—an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wizards have <i>banks?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Goblins?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah—so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh
that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the
world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe—’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’
fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.”
Hagrid drew himself up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer
him. Fetchin’ you gettin’ things from Gringotts—knows he can trust me, see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite
clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired
was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for
another boat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Flew,” said Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Flew?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah—but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic
now I’ve got yeh.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at
Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry
another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter—er—speed things up a bit, would
yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid
pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat,
and they sped off toward land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Spells—enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper
as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the highsecurity vaults. And
then yeh gotta find yer way—Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see.
Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh
did manage ter get yer hands on summat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his
newspaper, the <i>Daily Prophet.</i>  Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that
people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult,
he’d never had so many questions in his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid
muttered, turning the page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could
stop himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer
Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got
the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every
morning, askin’ fer advice.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But what does a Ministry of Magic <i>do?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that
there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Why?</i>  Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic
solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall.
Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the
street.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the
little town to the station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid
twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things
like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles
dream up, eh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up,
“did you say there are <i>dragons</i>  at Gringotts?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a
dragon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’d <i>like</i>  one?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wanted one ever since I was a kid—here we go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had reached the station. There was a train to London in
five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called
it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up
two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted
stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh
need.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the
night before, and read:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid
seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there
in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and
complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said
as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined
with shops.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all
Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music
stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it
could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary
people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them?
Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not
all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known
that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow,
even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry
couldn’t help trusting him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky
Cauldron. It’s a famous place.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a tiny, grubby looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed
it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t
glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record
shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact,
Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.
Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old
women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them
was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old
bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz
of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they
waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The
usual, Hagrid?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid,
clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is
this—can this be ?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and
silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter…
what an honor.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and
seized his hand, tears in his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him.
The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone
out. Hagrid was beaming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next
moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you
at last.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Always wanted to shake your hand—I’m all of a flutter.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the
name, Dedalus Diggle.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top
hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at
everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!” Harry shook hands again and
again—Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One
of his eyes was twitching.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor
Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s
hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor
Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it,
eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment,
I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He
looked terrified at the very thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to
himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid
managed to make himself heard over the babble.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Must get on—lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid
led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there
was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid grinned at Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor
Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh—mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Is he always that nervous?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he
was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand
experience… They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty
bit o’ trouble with a hag—never been the same since. Scared of the students,
scared of his own subject now, where’s me umbrella?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid,
meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Three up… two across,” he muttered. “Right, stand back,
Harry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He tapped the wall three times with the point of his
umbrella.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The brick he had touched quivered—it wriggled—in the middle,
a small hole appeared—it grew wider and wider—a second later they were facing
an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that
twisted and turned out of sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the
archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink
instantly back into solid wall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the
nearest shop. Cauldrons—All Sizes—Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver—Self
Stirring—Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta
get yer money first.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his
head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at
everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their
shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they
passed, saying, “Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying
Eeylops Owl Emporium—Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of
about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in
it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand—fastest
ever—” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange
silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of
bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls
of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had reached a snowy white building that towered over
the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a
uniform of scarlet and gold, was—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked
up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than
Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very
long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a
second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Enter, stranger, but take heed</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Of what awaits the sin of greed,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>For those who take, but do not earn,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Must pay most dearly in their turn.</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>So if you seek beneath our floors</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>A treasure that was never yours,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Thief, you have been warned, beware</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Of finding more than treasure there.</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Like I said, Yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and
they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on
high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins
in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too
many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing
people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter
take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You have his key, sir?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started
emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog
biscuits over the goblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry
watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing
coals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The goblin looked at it closely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That seems to be in order.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,”
said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What
in vault seven hundred and thirteen.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The goblin read the letter carefully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will
have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all
the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward
one of the doors leading off the hall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and
thirteen?” Harry asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very
secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More ’n my job’s worth ter
tell yeh that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had
expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit
with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway
tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the
tracks toward them. They climbed in—Hagrid with some difficulty—and were off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting
passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork,
right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own
way, because Griphook wasn’t steering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he
kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a
passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late—they plunged
even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites
grew from the ceiling and floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the
cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask
me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last
beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against
the wall to stop his knees from trembling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came
billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold
coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All Harry’s—it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have
known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often
had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there
had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen
silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy
enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest
safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now,
please, and can we go more slowly?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“One speed only,” said Griphook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air
became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went
rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to
see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by
the scruff of his neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door
gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be
sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather
nasty grin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top
security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see
fabulous jewels at the very least—but at first he thought it was empty. Then he
noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor.
Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know
what it was, but knew better than to ask.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me
on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight
outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag
full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound
to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life—more
money than even Dudley had ever had.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward
Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I
slipped off fer a pick me up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts
carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop
alone, feeling nervous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in
mauve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak.
“Got the lot here—another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was
standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes.
Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his
head, and began to pin it to the right length.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the
street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then
I’m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don’t see why first
years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and
I’ll smuggle it in somehow.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Have <i>you</i>  got your own broom?” the boy went on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Play Quidditch at all?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch
could be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“I</i>  do—Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to
play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they,
but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been—imagine being in
Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more
interesting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding
toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and
pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the
boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of
servant, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy
less and less every second.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of <i>savage</i> —lives
in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to
do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Do</i>  you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is
he with you? Where are your parents?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like
going into the matter with this boy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But
they were <i>our</i>  kind, weren’t they?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do
you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways.
Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,
imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your
surname, anyway?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s
you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the
boy, hopped down from the footstool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the
drawling boy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had
bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s up?” said Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and
quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color
as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know—not
knowin’ about Quidditch!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about
the pate boy in Madam Malkin’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“—and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be
allowed in.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yer not <i>from</i>  a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh
<i>were</i> —he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk.
You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway,
what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with
magic in ’em in a long line o’ Muggles—look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a
sister!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what <i>is</i>  Quidditch?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like—like soccer in the
Muggle world—everyone follows Quidditch—played up in the air on broomsticks and
there’s four balls—sorta hard ter explain the rules.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a
lot o’ duffers, but—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly.
“There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin.
You-Know-Who was one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Vol—sorry—You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish
and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as
paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of
silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at
all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his
hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from <i>Curses and
Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest
Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More)</i>  by
Professor Vindictus Viridian.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use
magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid.
“An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of the curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more
study before yeh get ter that level.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either
(“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing
potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the
Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a
mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the
floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles
of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While
Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion
ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty
one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a
scoop).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just yer wand left—A yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a
birthday present.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry felt himself go red.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You don’t have to—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal.
Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at—an’ I don’
like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls,
they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which
had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel bright eyes. Harry now
carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head
under her wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like
Professor Quirrell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve
had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivander’s left now—only place
fer wands, Ollivander’s, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A magic wand… this was what Harry had been really looking
forward to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters
over the door read <i>Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C.</i>  A
single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as
they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly
chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered
a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just
occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled
neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled.
The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid
must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got
quickly off the spindly chair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes
shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing
you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It
seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a
quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would
blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand.
Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration.
Well, I say your father favored it—it’s really the wand that chooses the
wizard, of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were
almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And that’s where…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s
forehead with a long, white finger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said
softly. “Thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in
the wrong hands… well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world
to do…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted
Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again… Oak,
sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half
when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Er—yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet.
“I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added brightly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But you don’t <i>use</i>  them?” said Mr. Ollivander
sharply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped
his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look.
“Well, now—Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver
markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Er—well, I’m right handed,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from
shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and
round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a
powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail
feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the
same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of
course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was
measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was
flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into
a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and
dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a
wave.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a
bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy.
Try—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry tried—but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too,
was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, no here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half
inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander
was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the
spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the
happier he seemed to become.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect
match here somewhere—I wonder, now—yes, why not—unusual combination—holly and
phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers.
He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty
air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework,
throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and
Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well…
how curious… how very curious…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in
brown paper, still muttering, “Curious… curious…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sorry,” said Harry, “but<i>what’s</i>  curious?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every
single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand,
gave another feather—just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should
be destined for this wand when it’s brother—why, it’s brother gave you that
scar.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry swallowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how
these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember… I think we must
expect great things from you, Mr. Potter… After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
did great things—terrible, yes, but great.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too
much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them
from his shop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and
Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back
through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked
down the road; he didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the
Underground, laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages, with the
snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into
Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him
on the shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic
seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange,
somehow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best
birthday of his life—and yet—he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those
people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander… but I don’t
know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous
and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when
Vol—sorry—I mean, the night my parents died.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and
eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone
starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I
know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll
have a great time at Hogwarts—I did—still do, ’smatter of fact.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back
to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’
September—King’s Cross—it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys,
send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me… See yeh soon,
Harry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch
Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose
against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>6. THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True,
Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt
Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do
anything, or shout at him—in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half
terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were
empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit
depressing after a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had
decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in <i>A History of Magic.</i> 
His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the
night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was
lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept
bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off
another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to
September the first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to
his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he
went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on
television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley
screamed and ran from the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Er—Uncle Vernon?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Er—I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to—to go to
Hogwarts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncle Vernon grunted again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually
spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic
carpets all got punctures, have they?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry didn’t say anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where is this school, anyway?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first
time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters
at eleven o’clock,” he read.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His aunt and uncle stared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Platform what?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nine and three-quarters.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no
platform nine and three-quarters.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s on my ticket.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them.
You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re
going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep
things friendly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got
to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too
excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans
because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes—he’d
change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had
everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then
paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s
huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had
talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon
dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry
thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the
platforms with a nasty grin on his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine—platform ten. Your
platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built
it yet, do they?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic
number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to
it, and in the middle, nothing at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier
smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive
away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on
earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks,
because of Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform
nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry
couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get
annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry
asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there
wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters.
Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the
arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he
had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a
trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to
do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He
wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s
stand between platforms nine and ten.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and
he caught a few words of what they were saying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“—packed with Muggles, of course—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was
talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a
trunk like Harry’s in front of him—and they had an <i>owl.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They
stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red
headed, who was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right,
Percy, you go first.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms
nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it—but just
as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large
crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last
backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman,
you call yourself our mother? Can’t you <i>tell</i>  I’m George?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sorry, George, dear.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His
twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second
later, he had gone—but how had he done it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier
he was almost there—and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was nothing else for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new,
too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall,
thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is—the thing is, I don’t know
how to—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry
nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk
straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be
scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a
run if you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Er—okay,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It
looked very solid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their
way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash
right into that barrier and then he’d be in trouble—leaning forward on his
cart, he broke into a heavy run—the barrier was coming nearer and nearer—he
wouldn’t be able to stop—the cart was out of control—he was a foot away—he
closed his eyes ready for the crash—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It didn’t come… he kept on running… he opened his eyes. A
scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign
overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw
a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words <i>Platform
Nine and Three-quarters</i>  on it, He had done it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the
chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their
legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble
and the scraping of heavy trunks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first few carriages were already packed with students,
some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over
seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.
He passed a round faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, <i>Neville,”</i>  he heard the old woman sigh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people
around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty
compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then
started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it
up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully
on his foot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Want a hand?” It was one of the red haired twins he’d
followed through the barrier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, please,” Harry panted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away
in a corner of the compartment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his
eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at
Harry’s lightning scar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to
Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What?” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Harry Potter,”</i>  chorused the twins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning
red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s open
door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fred? George? Are you there?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Coming, Mom.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could
watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying.
Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she
grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Mom</i> —geroff—” He wriggled free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” said one
of the twins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shut up,” said Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where’s Percy?” said their mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s coming now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already
changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny
silver badge on his chest with the letter <i>P</i>  on it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the
prefects have got two compartments to themselves—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, are you a <i>prefect,</i>  Percy?” said one of the
twins, with an air of great surprise. “You should have said something, we had
no idea.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,”
said the other twin. “Once—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Or twice—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A minute—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All summer—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the
twins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Because he’s a <i>prefect,”</i>  said their mother fondly.
“All right, dear, well, have a good term—send me an owl when you get there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned
to the twins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now, you two—this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one
more owl telling me you’ve—you’ve blown up a toilet or—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s <i>not funny.</i>  And look after Ron.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the
twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know that black haired boy who was near us in the
station? Know who he is?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Harry Potter!”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry heard the little girl’s voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh
please…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t
something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there—like lightning.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Poor <i>dear</i> —no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He
was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what
You-Know-Who looks like?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their mother suddenly became very stern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As
though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right, keep your hair on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A whistle sounded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered
onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye,
and their younger sister began to cry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“George!”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Only joking, Mom.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving
and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train
until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train
rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of
excitement. He didn’t know what he was going to but it had to be better than
what he was leaving behind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest
redheaded boy came in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat
opposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at
Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked.
Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, Ron.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The twins were back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train—Lee
Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right,” mumbled Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves?
Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment
door shut behind them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s
jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got—you know…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He pointed at Harry’s forehead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron
stared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So that’s where You-Know-Who—?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well—I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few
moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked
quickly out of the window again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron
just as interesting as Ron found him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Er—Yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a second
cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So you must know loads of magic already.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding
families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are
they like?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Horrible—well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and
cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy.
“I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to
live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left—Bill was head boy and Charlie
was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a
lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really
funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no
big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with
five brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old
rat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat,
which was asleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes
up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t
aff—I mean, I got Scabbers instead.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much,
because he went back to staring out of the window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being
able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life until a
month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes
and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“…and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about
being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron gasped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What?” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“You said You-Know-Who’s name!”</i>  said Ron, sounding
both shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, of all people—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m not trying to be <i>brave</i>  or anything, saying the
name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. See what I mean? I’ve got
loads to learn… I bet,” he added, voicing for the first time something that had
been worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in the class.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Muggle
families and they learn quick enough.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While they had been talking, the train had carried them out
of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were
quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside
in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,
“Anything off the cart, dears?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but
Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches. Harry
went out into the corridor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and
now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as
many Mars Bars as he could carry—but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars. What she
did have were Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum,
Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number
of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss
anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles
and seven bronze Knuts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the
compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hungry, are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin
pasty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There
were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, “She always
forgets I don’t like corned beef.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty.
“Go on—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn’t
got much time,” he added quickly, “you know, with five of us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had
anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling,
sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes,
and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of
Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not <i>really</i>  frogs, are they?” He was starting
to feel that nothing would surprise him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing
Agrippa.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know—Chocolate Frogs have
cards, inside them, you know, to collect—famous witches and wizards. I’ve got
about five hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card.
It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose,
and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the
name Albus Dumbledore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So <i>this</i>  is Dumbledore!” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron.
“Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa—thanks—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry turned over his card and read:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'>CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Considered by many the greatest wizard
of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark
wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s
blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor
Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his
astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s gone!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said
Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her…
do you want it? You can start collecting.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to
be unwrapped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle
world, people just stay put in photos.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded amazed.
<i>“Weird!”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on
his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the
frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t
keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but
Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He
finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her
nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When
they say every flavor, they <i>mean</i>  every flavor—you know, you get all the
ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get
spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit
into a corner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bleaaargh—see? Sprouts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry
got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and
was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t
touch, which turned out to be pepper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The countryside now flying past the window was becoming
wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and
dark green hills.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the
round faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He
looked tearful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He
keeps getting away from me!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’ll turn up,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought
a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I
can’t talk.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,”
said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more
interesting, but the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very
battered looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was
glinting at the end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid
open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him.
She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She
had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front
teeth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but
the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Er—all right.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He cleared his throat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>“Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed
gray and fast asleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well,
it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and
it’s all worked for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a
surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean,
it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard—I’ve learned all
our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough—I’m
Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She said all this very fast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned
face that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Harry Potter,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of
course—I got a few extra books for background reading, and you’re in <i>Modern
Magical History</i>  and <i>The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts</i>  and <i>Great
Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I
could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be
in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the
best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be
too bad… Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better
change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron.
He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell—George gave it to me, bet
he knew it was a dud.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him
again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not.
I don’t suppose Ravenclaw <i>would</i>  be too bad, but imagine if they put me
in Slytherin.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s the house Vol—, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking
depressed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit
lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off houses. “So what do your
oldest brothers do now that they’ve left, anyway?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished
school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa
doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear about Gringotts? It’s
been all over the <i>Daily Prophet,</i>  but I don’t suppose you get that with
the Muggles—someone tried to rob a high security vault.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry stared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Really? What happened to them?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been
caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round
Gringotts, but they don’t think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course,
everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s
behind it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to
get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this
was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more
comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s your favorite Quidditch team?” Ron asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Er—I don’t know any,” Harry confessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best
game in the world—” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the
positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his
brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just
taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door
slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione
Granger this time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at
once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at
Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train
that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of
them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the
pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy
carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco
Malfoy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a
snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are.
My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children
than they can afford.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some
wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go
making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself,
thanks,” he said coolly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his
pale cheeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly.
“Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They
didn’t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like
the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both Harry and Ron stood up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he
felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But we don’t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten
all our food and you still seem to have some.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron—Ron
leapt forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a
horrible yell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little
teeth sunk deep into Goyle’s knuckle—Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle
swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and
hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought
there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard
footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What <i>has</i>  been going on?” she said, looking at the
sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He
looked closer at Scabbers. “No—I don’t believe it—he’s gone back to sleep—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so he had.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’ve met Malfoy before?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some
of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said
they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father
didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He turned to Hermione. “Can
we help you with something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been
up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there. You
haven’t been fighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get
there!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at
her. “Would you mind leaving while we change?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right—I only came in here because people outside are
behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a
sniffy voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the
window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep
purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long
black robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers
underneath them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching
Hogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will
be taken to the school separately.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked
pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets
and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed
their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered
in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students,
and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All
right there, Harry?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“C’mon, follow me—any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now!
Firs’ years follow me!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what
seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that
Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the
boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ye’ all get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid
called over his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a loud “Oooooh!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great
black take. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows
sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a
fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were
followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself.
“Right then—FORWARD!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding
across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up
at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and
nearer to the cliff on which it stood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the
cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a
curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried
along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the
castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered
out onto rocks and pebbles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was
checking the boats as people climbed out of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands.
Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out
at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around
the huge, oak front door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the
castle door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>7. THE SORTING HAT</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The door swung open at once. A tall, black haired witch in
emerald green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s first
thought was that this was not someone to cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you
could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit
with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to
make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper
floors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone
floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the
right the rest of the school must already be here—but Professor McGonagall
showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded
in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start
of term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great
Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important
ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your
family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house,
sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,
Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has
produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your
triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house
points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the
house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever
house becomes yours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in
front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as
much as you can while you are waiting.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was
fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried
to flatten his hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor
McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How exactly do they sort us into houses?” he asked Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I
think he was joking.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the
whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet—what on earth would he have to
do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked
around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was
talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all
the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard
not to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d
had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow
turned his teacher’s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second
now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in
the air—several people behind him screamed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What the—?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts
had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly white and slightly transparent,
they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the
first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was
saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he
deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a
ghost—I say, what are you all doing here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the
first years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nobody answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them.
“About to be Sorted, I suppose?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few people nodded mutely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old
house, you know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting
Ceremony’s about to start.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts
floated away through the opposite wall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first
years, “and follow me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry
got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they
walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double
doors into the Great Hall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid
place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in
midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.
These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of
the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor
McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line
facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces
staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted
here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to
avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling
dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the
sky outside. I read about it in <i>Hogwarts, A History.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and
that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall
silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the
stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and
extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it,</i> 
Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing—noticing that everyone in
the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds,
there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened
wide like a mouth—and the hat began to sing:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>But don’t judge on what you see,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>I’ll eat myself if you can find</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>A smarter hat than me.</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>You can keep your bowlers black,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Your top hats sleek and tall,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>And I can cap them all.</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>There’s nothing hidden in your head</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>The Sorting Hat can’t see,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>So try me on and I will tell you</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Where you ought to be.</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>You might belong in Gryffindor,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Where dwell the brave at heart,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Their daring, nerve, and chivalry</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Set Gryffindors apart;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>You might belong in Hufflepuff,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Where they are just and loyal,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Those patient Hufflepuffs are true</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>And unafraid of toil;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>If you’ve a ready mind,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Where those of wit and learning,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Will always find their kind;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Or perhaps in Slytherin</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>You’ll make your real friends,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Those cunning folk use any means</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>To achieve their ends.</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>So put me on! Don’t be afraid!</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>And don’t get in a flap!</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>You’re in safe hands (though I have
none)</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>For I’m a Thinking Cap!”</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its
song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to
Harry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better
than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without
everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel
brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned
a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll
of parchment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on
the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line,
put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments
pause—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to
sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving
merrily at her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bones, Susan!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off
to sit next to Hannah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Boot, Terry!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“RAVENCLAW!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The table second from the left clapped this time; several
Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown,
Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left
exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it
was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought
they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick
now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had
always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one
wanted Dudley to think they liked him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“HUFFLEPUFF!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at
once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the
sandy haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole
minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Granger, Hermione!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly
on her head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always
do when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just
sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall
jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d
better get back on the train?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad,
was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to
decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off
still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to
“MacDougal, Morag.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got
his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed,
“SLYTHERIN!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking
pleased with himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There weren’t many people left now. “Moon”…, “Nott”…,
“Parkinson”…, then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”…, then “Perks,
Sally Anne”…, and then, at last—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Potter, Harry!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like
little hissing fires all over the hall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Potter, did she say?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“The</i>  Harry Potter?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his
eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second
he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very
difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s
talent,&nbsp;ah my goodness, yes—and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now
that’s interesting… So where shall I put you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not
Slytherin, not Slytherin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure?
You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will
help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that—no? Well, if you’re
sure—better be GRYFFINDOR!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall.
He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so
relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that
he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his
hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got
Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The
ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just
plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest
him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned
back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat
Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of
the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in
the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor
Quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking
very peculiar in a large purple turban.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And now there were only three people left to be sorted.
“Thomas, Dean,” a black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the
Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s
turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a
second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the
chair next to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley Pompously
across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall
rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just
realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at
the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more
than to see them all there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Welcome,” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!
Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they
are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thank you!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry
didn’t know whether to laugh or not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Is he—a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the
world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now
piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table:
roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and
steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas,
carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never
been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that
Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit
of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly,
watching Harry cut up his steak, “Can’t you—?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I haven’t eaten for nearly four hundred years,” said the
ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve
introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington at your service. Resident
ghost of Gryffindor Tower.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told
me about you—you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I would <i>prefer</i>  you to call me Sir Nicholas de
Mimsy—” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Nearly</i>  Headless? How can you be <i>nearly</i> 
headless?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little
chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Like <i>this,”</i>  he said irritably. He seized his left
ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as
if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done
it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly
Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So—new
Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the house championship this
year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got
the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable—he’s
the Slytherin ghost.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible
ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained
with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see,
didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great
interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains
of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A
moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could
think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts,
trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned
to their families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom
didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a nasty
shock for him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The others laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said
Neville, “but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle
Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me—he
pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned—but nothing
happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was
hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid
offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced—all the way
down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was
crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in
here—they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle
Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were
talking about lessons (“I <i>do</i>  hope they start right away, there’s so
much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know,
turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very
difficult”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort
of thing—”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up
at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor
McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his
absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose,
and sallow skin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It happened very suddenly. The hook nosed teacher looked
past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes—and a sharp, hot pain shot
across the scar on Harry’s forehead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What is it?” asked Percy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“N-nothing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake
off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look—a feeling that he
didn’t like Harry at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked
Percy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s
looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t
want to—everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the
Dark Arts, Snape.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at
him again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor
Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ahem—just a few more words now that we are all fed and
watered. I have a few start of term notices to give you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is
forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to
remember that as well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the
Weasley twins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to
remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the
term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam
Hooch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third
floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not
wish to die a very painful death.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd,
because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere—the
forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might
have told us prefects, at least.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!”
cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become
rather fixed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying
to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose
high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and
off we go!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the school bellowed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty
Hogwarts,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Teach us something please,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Whether we be old and bald</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Or young with scabby knees,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Our heads could do with filling</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>With some interesting stuff,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>For now they’re bare and full of air,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Dead flies and bits of fluff,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>So teach us things worth knowing,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Bring back what we’ve forgot,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Just do your best, we’ll do the rest,</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>And learn until our brains all rot.</p>

<p class=Stanza style='text-indent:1.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everybody finished the song at different times. At last,
only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.
Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had
finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all
we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the
chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s
legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food.
He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along
the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led
them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They
climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering
how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of
them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A
poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves—show yourself!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon,
answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and
a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking
sticks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties!
What fun!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean
it!” barked Percy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the
walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats
of armor as he passed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set
off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t even
listen to us prefects. Here we are.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very
fat woman in a pink silk dress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Password?” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward
to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it—Neville
needed a leg up—and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy,
round room full of squashy armchairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory
and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase—they were
obviously in one of the towers—they found their beds at last: five four posters
hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up.
Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the
hangings. “Get <i>off,</i>  Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle
tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a
very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept
talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it
was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it
got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully—and
there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it—then Malfoy turned
into the hook nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold—there was
a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next
day, he didn’t remember the dream at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>8. THE POTIONS MASTER</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There, look.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wearing the glasses?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did you see his face?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did you see his scar?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his
dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to
get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.
Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his
way to classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were a hundred and forty two staircases at Hogwarts:
wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on
a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to
jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or
tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at
all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where
anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the
portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor
could walk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock
when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly
Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction,
but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if
you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on
your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or
sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the
caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him
on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through
a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds
corridor on the third floor. He wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they
were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in
the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust
colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch’s. She patrolled
the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of
line, and she’d whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two seconds later.
Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except
perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts.
The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give
Mrs. Norris a good kick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the
classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out,
than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had to study the night skies through their telescopes
every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the
movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses
behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor
Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and
fungi, and found out what they were used for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was
the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when
he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to
teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled
down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little
wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start
of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he
gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been
quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave
them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous
magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class
will leave and not come back. You have been warned.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They
were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized
they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.
After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and
started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only
Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall
showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare
smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The class everyone had really been looking forward to was
Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of
a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to
ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to
get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by
an African prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but
they weren’t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan
asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went
pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that
a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it
was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he
went.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles
behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like
him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much
to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally
managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting
lost once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar
on his porridge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s
Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them—we’ll be able to see if
it’s true.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor
McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving
them a huge pile of homework the day before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this
by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about
a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,
circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and
packages onto their laps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes
flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in
the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered
down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s
plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Dear Harry,</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>I know you get Friday afternoons off,
so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>I want to hear all about your first
week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Hagrid</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled <i>Yes, please, see
you later</i>  on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward
to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had
happened to him so far.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that
Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew
he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry—he <i>hated</i>  him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It
was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy
enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll
call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah, Yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new—<i>celebrity.”</i>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered
behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the
class. His eyes were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth.
They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of
potionmaking,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they
caught every word—like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a
class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand waving here, many
of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really
understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering
fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching
the mind, ensnaring the senses… I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory,
even stopper death—if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually
have to teach.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron
exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her
seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added
powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Powdered root of what to an infusion of what?</i>  Harry
glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot into
the air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Snape’s lips curled into a sneer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Tut, tut—fame clearly isn’t everything.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He ignored Hermione’s hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you
to find me a bezoar?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would
go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a
bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking
with laughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh,
Potter?” Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He
had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to
remember everything in <i>One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and
wolfsbane?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the
dungeon ceiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does,
though, why don’t you try her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus
winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information,
Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as
the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a
goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane,
they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why
aren’t you all copying that down?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over
the noise, Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for
your cheek, Potter.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions
lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a
simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching
them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone
except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at
the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green
smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to
melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across
the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the whole
class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the
potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up
all over his arms and legs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away
with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before
taking the cauldron off the fire?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his
nose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus.
Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You—Potter—why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills?
Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another
point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but
Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn
very nasty.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later,
Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two points for
Gryffindor in his very first week—<i>why</i>  did Snape hate him so much?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points off Fred
and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At five to three they left the castle and made their way
across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the
forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front
door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from
inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out, saying, <i>“Back,</i> 
Fang—<i>back.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled
the door open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hang on,” he said. <i>“Back,</i>  Fang.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of
an enormous black boarhound.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were
hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in
the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang,
who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was
clearly not as fierce as he looked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling
water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s
freckles. “I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the
forest.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost
broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told
Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and
drooled all over his robes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch “that
old git.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce
her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she
follows me everywhere? Can’t get rid of her—Fitch puts her up to it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron,
told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But he seemed to really <i>hate</i>  me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite
meet his eyes when he said that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him
a lot—great with animals.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a
piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting
from the <i>Daily Prophet:</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><b>GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST</b> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Investigations continue into the break
in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or
witches unknown.</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'>Gringotts goblins today insisted that
nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied
the same day.</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'>“But we’re not telling you what was in
there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a
Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone
had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break in happened on
my birthday! It might’ve been happening while we were there!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet
Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry
read the story again. <i>The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied
earlier that same day. </i> Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and
thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package.
Had that been what the thieves were looking for?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their
pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry
thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to think
about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where
was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell
Harry?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>9. THE MIDNIGHT DUEL</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more
than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first year
Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up
with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice pinned
up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would
be starting on Thursday—and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning
together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always wanted. To
make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than
anything else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said
Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good he is
at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained
loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told
long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping
Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan
told it, he’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his
broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost
hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families
talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean
Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn’t see what was
exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry
had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make
the players move.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because
his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she’d had
good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of
accidents even with both feet on the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as
Neville was. This was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book—not
that she hadn’t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with
flying tips she’d gotten out of a library book called <i>Quidditch Through the
Ages</i> . Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything
that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was
very pleased when Hermione’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note,
something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy’s eagle owl
was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened
gloatingly at the Slytherin table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his
grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a
large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I forget
things—this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you
hold it tight like this and if it turns red—oh…” His face fell, because the
Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “…you’ve forgotten something…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when
Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out
of his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping
for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble
quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s going on?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the
table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and
Goyle behind him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At three thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other
Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first
flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their
feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the
opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying
darkly in the distance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty
broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George
Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to
vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray
hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. “Everyone
stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the
twigs stuck out at odd angles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam
Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“UP!” everyone shouted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one
of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground,
and Neville’s hadn’t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when
you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville’s voice that said
only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms
without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their
grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it
wrong for years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground,
hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then
come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle—three—two—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left
on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s
lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising
straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle—twelve feet—twenty feet. Harry saw
his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip
sideways off the broom and—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WHAM—a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on
the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and
started to drift lazily toward the Forbidden Forest and out of sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as
his.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy—it’s
all right, up you get.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She turned to the rest of the class.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the
hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of
Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neville, his face tear streaked, clutching his wrist,
hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into
laughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did you see his face, the great lump?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other Slytherins joined in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a
hard faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought <i>you’d</i>  like fat little
crybabies, Parvati.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something
out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone
stopped talking to watch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy smiled nastily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find—how
about—up a tree?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Give it <i>here!”</i>  Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt
onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he <i>could</i>  fly
well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, “Come and
get it, Potter!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry grabbed his broom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“No!”</i>  shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us
not to move—you’ll get us all into trouble.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He
mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air
rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of
fierce joy he realized he’d found something he could do without being
taught—this was easy, this was <i>wonderful.</i>  He pulled his broomstick up a
little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the
ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair.
Malfoy looked stunned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that
broom!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking
worried.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and
grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a
javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about
face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,”
Harry called.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw the
glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the
air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle
down—next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball—wind
whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching—he stretched
out his hand—a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his
broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall
clutched safely in his fist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“HARRY POTTER!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor
McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Never</i> —in all my time at Hogwarts—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and
her glasses flashed furiously, “—how <i>dare</i>  you—might have broken your
neck—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It wasn’t his fault, Professor—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Be quiet, Miss Patil.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But Malfoy—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s <i>enough,</i>  Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me,
now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant
faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode
toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to
say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with
his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him;
he had to jog to keep up. Now he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks.
He’d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he
turned up on the doorstep?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and
still Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors
and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she
was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to
stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant. His stomach
twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while
he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened
the door and poked her head inside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a
moment?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was
going to use on him?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth year boy who
came out of Flitwicles class looking confused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they
marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was
empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a
bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall
slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood—I’ve found you a Seeker.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you serious, Professor?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy’s
a natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a
broomstick, Potter?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going
on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started
coming back to his legs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive,”
Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley
couldn’t have done it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true
at once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor
McGonagall explained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now
walking around Harry and staring at him. “Light—speedy—we’ll have to get him a
decent broom, Professor—a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t
bend the first year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. <i>Flattened</i> 
in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for
weeks…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at
Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may
change my mind about punishing you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then she suddenly smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an
excellent Quidditch player himself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’re <i>joking.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what
had happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a
piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all
about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Seeker?”</i>  he said. “But first years <i>never</i>
—you must be the youngest house player in about a century, said Harry,
shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement
of the afternoon. “Wood told me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at
Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell
anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted
Harry, and hurried over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us.
We’re on the team too—Beaters.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure
this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team
is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping
when he told us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a
new secret passageway out of the school.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy
that we found in our first week. See you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less
welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train
back to the Muggles?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and
you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There was of
course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was
full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and
scowl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight,
if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only—no contact. What’s the matter? Never
heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m his
second, who’s yours?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in
the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean, you’re my
second?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron
casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s
face, he added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with
real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each
other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he
expected you to refuse, anyway.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were
saying—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bet you could,” Ron muttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“—and you <i>mustn’t</i>  go wandering around the school at
night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re
bound to be. It’s really very selfish of you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good-bye,” said Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to
the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus
falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all
evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d better dodge
it, because I can’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance
they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was
pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s
sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness—this was his big chance to
beat Malfoy face to face. He couldn’t miss it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Half past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and
crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor
common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the
armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole
when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going
to do this, Harry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink
bathrobe and a frown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“You!”</i>  said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy—he’s
a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of
the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She followed
Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t you <i>care</i>  about Gryffindor, do you <i>only</i> 
care about yourselves, <i>I</i>  don’t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and
you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about
Switching Spells.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Go away.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said
when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had
turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself
facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and
Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, we’re
going to be late.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when
Hermione caught up with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m coming with you,” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You are not.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch
to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was
trying to stop you, and you can back me up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’ve got some nerve—” said Ron loudly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard
something.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a sort of snuffling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on
the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours,
I couldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’
but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How’s your arm?” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended it
in about a minute.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good—well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll
see you later—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, “I
don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at
Hermione and Neville.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve
learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how
to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and
beckoned them all forward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight
from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs.
Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and
tiptoed toward the trophy room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy
cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and
statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping
their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in
case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only
just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn’t Malfoy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror struck, Harry
waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they
scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had
barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter,
“probably hiding.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they
began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear
Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke
into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them
toppled right into a suit of armor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole
castle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the
gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following—they swung around
the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead,
without any idea where they were or where they were going—they ripped through a
tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came
out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy
room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the
cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and
spluttering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I—<i>told</i> —you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the
stitch in her chest, “I—told—you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,” said Ron,
“quickly as possible.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You realize
that, don’t you? He was never going to meet you—Filch knew someone was going to
be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to
tell her that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Let’s go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone more
than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a
classroom in front of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of
delight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shut up, Peeves—please—you’ll get us thrown out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peeves cackled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut,
tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a saintly
voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your own good, you know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves
this was a big mistake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS OUT OF BED
DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the
end of the corridor where they slammed into a door—and it was locked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the
door, “We’re done for! This is the end!” They could hear footsteps, Filch
running as fast as he could toward Peeves’s shouts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand,
tapped the lock, and whispered, <i>“Alohomora!”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lock clicked and the door swung open—they piled through
it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick,
tell me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Say ‘please.’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now <i>where did they go?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in
his annoying singsong voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right—<i>please.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you
didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves
whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I think
we’ll be okay—get <i>off,</i>  Neville!” For Neville had been tugging on the
sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute. <i>“What?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry turned around—and saw, quite clearly, what. For a
moment, he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare—this was too much, on top of
everything that had happened so far.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a
corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it
was forbidden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog,
a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three
heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering
in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes
from yellowish fangs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them,
and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their
sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over
that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry groped for the doorknob—between Filch and death, he’d
take Filch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They fell backward—Harry slammed the door shut, and they
ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to
look for them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they
hardly cared—all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between
them and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait
of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at
their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Never mind that—pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and
the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed,
trembling, into armchairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville,
indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that
locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one
does.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back
again. “You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you
see what it was standing on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet,
I was too busy with its heads.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, <i>not</i>  the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor.
It’s obviously guarding something.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She stood up, glaring at them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have
been killed—or worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron stared after her, his mouth open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her
along, wouldn’t you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about
as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something… What had Hagrid
said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to
hide—except perhaps Hogwarts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby
littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>10. HALLOWEEN</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and
Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three headed
dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another
one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have
been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering
what could possibly need such heavy protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Or both,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object
was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing
what it was without further clues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest
in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was
never going near the dog again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she
was such a bossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they
really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great
delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s
attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large
screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in
this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it
right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly
fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because
it said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.</i>
</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>It contains your new Nimbus Two
Thousand, but I don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll
all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven
o’clock for your first training session.</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Professor McGonagall</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note
to Ron to read.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. “I’ve never
even <i>touched</i>  one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick
in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they
found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package
from Harry and felt it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry
with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this
time, Potter, first years aren’t allowed them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron couldn’t resist it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus Two
Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron
grinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same league as
the Nimbus.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford
half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your brothers have to
save up twig by twig.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at
Malfoy’s elbow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Potter’s been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming
at Harry. “Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances,
Potter. And what model is it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not to
laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. “And it’s really thanks to Malfoy
here that I’ve got it,” he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at
Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion. “Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they
reached the top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s
Remembrall I wouln’t be on the team…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?”
came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,
looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much
good.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons
that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was
lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be
learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing
what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two
Thousand at last.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s
bedspread.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms,
thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a
long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near
the top.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set
off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d never been inside the stadium
before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the
spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the
field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the
little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they
were fifty feet high.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his
broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling—he swooped in and out
of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand
turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, Potter, come down!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden
crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall
meant… you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this
evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He opened the crate. Inside were four different sized balls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to
understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each
side. Three of them are called Chasers.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright
red ball about the size of a soccer ball.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers
throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to
score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops.
Follow me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops
to score,” Harry recited. “So—that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks
with six hoops, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Never mind,” said Harry quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the
Keeper. I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the
other team from scoring.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined
to remember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what
are they for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball
bat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said.
“These two are the Bludgers.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly
smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to
escape the straps holding them inside the box.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one
of the Bludgers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted
straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from
breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air—it zoomed around
their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it
to the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into
the crate and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying to
knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team—the
Weasley twins are ours—it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers
and try and knock them toward the other team. So—think you’ve got all that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper
guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,”
Harry reeled off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Very good,” said Wood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Er—have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked,
hoping he sounded offhand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but
nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That’s
you. And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“—unless they crack my head open.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the
Bludgers—I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last
ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size
of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“This,”</i>  said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s
the most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so
fast and difficult to see. It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to
weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it
before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch
wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win.
That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the
Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages—I think the record is three months,
they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, that’s it—any questions?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all
right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood,
carefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it.
Let’s try you out with a few of these.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and
a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf
balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted.
After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That Quidditch cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said
Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if
you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England
if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with
Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry
could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two
months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons,
too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the
basics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of
baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick
announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects
fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make
Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into
pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief,
because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be
working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was
angrier about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s
broomstick had arrived.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been
practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books
as usual. “Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic
words properly is very important, too—never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said
‘s’ instead of ‘f’ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked,
but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the
desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire
to it—Harry had to put it out with his hat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Wingardium Leviosa!”</i>  he shouted, waving his long
arms like a windmill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s
Wing-<i>gar</i> -dium Levi-<i>o</i> -sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her
wand, and said, <i>“Wingardium Leviosa!”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet
above their heads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping.
“Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as
they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was
Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face—and was startled to see that she
was in tears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think she heard you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She
must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen
all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast,
Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione
was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still
more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where
the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling
while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the
candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden
plates, as it had at the start of term banquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when
Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on
his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped
against the table, and gasped, “Troll—in the dungeons—thought you ought to
know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding
from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the
dormitories immediately!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Percy was in his element.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the
troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years
coming through! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the
stairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said
Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They passed different groups of people hurrying in different
directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs,
Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ve just thought—Hermione.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What about her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She doesn’t know about the troll.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron bit his lip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not see
us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other
way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’
bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps
behind them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone
griffin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He
crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in
the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Search me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor
after Snape’s fading footsteps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held
up his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can you smell something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a
mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then they heard it—a low grunting, and the shuffling
footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed—at the end of a passage to the left,
something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched
as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a
dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald
head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with
flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a
huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It
waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the
room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The keys in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it
in.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good idea,” said Ron nervously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the
troll wasn’t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to
grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Yes!”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the
passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their
hearts stop—a high, petrified scream—and it was coming from the chamber they’d
just chained up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Hermione!”</i>  they said together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did
they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key,
fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite,
looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking
the sinks off the walls as it went.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a
tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered
around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes
saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it
went.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oy, pea brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the
chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn’t even seem to notice
the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning
its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come on, run, <i>run!”</i>  Harry yelled at Hermione,
trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat
against the wall, her mouth open with terror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll
berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way
to escape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry then did something that was both very brave and very
stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the
troll’s neck from behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even
a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry’s
wand had still been in his hand when he’d jumped—it had gone straight up one of
the troll’s nostrils.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club,
with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip
him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his
own wand—not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first
spell that came into his head: <i>“Wingardium Leviosa!”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high,
high up into the air, turned slowly over—and dropped, with a sickening crack,
onto its owner’s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its
face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron
was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was Hermione who spoke first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Is it—dead?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been
knocked out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It
was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Urgh—troll boogers.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He wiped it on the troll’s trousers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them
look up. They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of
course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll’s roars. A
moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely
followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look
at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet,
clutching his heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking
at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white.
Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor
McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still
standing with his wand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t
you in your dormitory?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the
floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then a small voice came out of the shadows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Please, Professor McGonagall—they were looking for me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Miss Granger!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I went looking for the troll because I—I thought I could
deal with it on my own—you know, because I’ve read all about them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright
lie to a teacher?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his
wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time
to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new
to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well—in that case…” said Professor McGonagall, staring at
the three of them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of
tackling a mountain troll on your own?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was
the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending
she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out
sweets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for
this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you. If you’re not
hurt at all, you’d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing
the feast in their houses.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years
could have taken on a full grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five
points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all
until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell
of the troll, quite apart from anything else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron
admitted. “Mind you, we <i>did</i>  save her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the
thing in with her,” Harry reminded him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Pig snout,” they said and entered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating
the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door,
waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them
looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their
friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other,
and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>11. QUIDDITCH</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The
mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel.
Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the
upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a
long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be
playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus
Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house
championship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided
that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news
that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn’t know which
was worse—people telling him he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be
running around underneath him holding a mattress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend.
He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all his homework without her, what
with all the last minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had
also lent him <i>Quidditch Through the Ages,</i>  which turned out to be a very
interesting read.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of
committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World
Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and
that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although
people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and
turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules
since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much
nicer for it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them
were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a
bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing
with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry
noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer
together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.
Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape’s eye. He limped
over. He hadn’t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell
them off anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was <i>Quidditch Through the Ages.</i>  Harry showed him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Library books are not to be taken outside the school,” said
Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as
Snape limped away. “Wonder what’s wrong with his leg?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron
bitterly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking
Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (“How
will you learn?”), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right
answers anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry felt restless. He wanted <i>Quidditch Through the Ages</i> 
back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid
of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he
could have it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry had an
idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was
no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a
try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside—and a horrible scene met his
eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his
robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was
handing Snape bandages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you supposed to
keep your eyes on all three heads at once?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“POTTER!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Snape’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes
quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I just wondered if I could have my book back.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“GET OUT! <i>OUT!”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from
Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. “What’s
the matter?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know what this means?” he finished breathlessly. “He
tried to get past that three headed dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going
when we saw him—he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d bet my broomstick <i>he</i> 
let that troll in, to make a diversion!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione’s eyes were wide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No—he wouldn’t, she said. “I know he’s not very nice, but
he wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or
something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I wouldn’t put anything past Snape.
But what’s he after? What’s that dog guarding?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same
question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn’t sleep. He tried to
empty his mind—he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match
in a few hours—but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg
wasn’t easy to forget.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall
was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of
everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t want anything.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m not hungry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto
the field.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan.
“Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup
on his sausages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the
stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats
might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was
going on sometimes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West
Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large
banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said <i>Potter for
President,</i>  and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor
lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the
paint flashed different colors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the
team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be
playing in green).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wood cleared his throat for silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Okay, men,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The big one,” said Fred Weasley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we
were on the team last year.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team
Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and,
hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud
cheers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the
field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once
they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking
particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry
thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of
his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President
over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mount your brooms, please.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were
off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of
Gryffindor—what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“JORDAN!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sorry, Professor.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the
commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to
Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve—back to
Johnson and—no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus
Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes—Flint flying like an eagle up
there—he’s going to sc—no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper
Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle—that’s Chaser Katie Bell of
Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and—OUCH—that must
have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger—Quaffle taken by the
Slytherins—that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he’s
blocked by a second Bludger—sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell
which—nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in
possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes—she’s really
flying—dodges a speeding Bludger—the goal posts are ahead—come on, now,
Angelina—Keeper Bletchley dives—misses—GRYFFINDORS SCORE!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans
from the Slytherins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Budge up there, move along.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hagrid!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough
space to join them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a large
pair of binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the
crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid,
raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game,
squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood’s
game plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,”
Wood had said. “We don’t want you attacked before you have to be.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop
the loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the
Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection
from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come
pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and
Fred Weasley came chasing after it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he beat
the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser
Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward
the—wait a moment—was that the Snitch?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the
Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had
passed his left ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived
downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it,
too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch all the Chasers seemed to
have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to
watch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was faster than Higgs—he could see the little round
ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead—he put on an extra spurt of speed—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors
below—Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry’s broom spun off
course, Harry holding on for dear life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free
shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the
Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off,
ref! Red card!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get shown
the red card and you’re out of the game!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid, however, was on Dean’s side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry
outta the air.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So—after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I mean, after that open and revolting foul—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Jordan, I’m warning you—”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor
Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor,
taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play,
Gryffindor still in possession.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning
dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden,
frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He
gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He’d never felt
anything like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to
buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their
riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts—he had
half a mind to ask Wood to call time out—and then he realized that his broom
was completely out of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t direct it
at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making
violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lee was still commentating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Slytherin in possession—Flint with the Quaffle—passes
Spinnet—passes Bell—hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his
nose—only joking, Professor—Slytherins score—A no…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed
that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher,
away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled. He
stared through his binoculars. “If I didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control
of his broom… but he can’t have…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the
stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just
managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a
wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with
only one hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?” Seamus
whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t nothing
interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic—no kid could do that to
a Nimbus Two Thousand.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid’s binoculars, but
instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray faced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape—look.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the
stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop
under his breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s doing something—jinxing the broom,” said Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What should we do?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Leave it to me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared.
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it
was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on
its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry
safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good—every time they got near
him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath
him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle
and scored five times without anyone noticing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape
stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn’t even stop to say
sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few,
well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of
Snape’s robes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he
was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off
him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row—Snape
would never know what had happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to
clamber back on to his broom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been sobbing
into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him
clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick—he hit the field
on all fours—coughed—and something gold fell into his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his head,
and the game ended in complete confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He didn’t <i>catch</i>  it, he nearly <i>swallowed</i> 
it,” Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no
difference—Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily
shouting the results—Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to
sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea
back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron and Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him.
He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had
gone on next to him in the stands. “Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering
what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried
to get past that three headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was
trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid dropped the teapot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Fluffy?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah—he’s mine—bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the
pub las’ year—I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes?” said Harry eagerly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. “That’s
top secret, that is.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But Snape’s trying to <i>steal</i>  it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher,
he’d do nothin’ of the sort.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her
mind about Snape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about
them! You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw
him!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’
know why Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a
student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh—yer meddlin’ in things that don’
concern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ you forget what it’s
guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel
involved, is there?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid looked furious with himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>12. THE MIRROR OF ERISED</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christmas was coming. One morning in mid December, Hogwarts
woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and
the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they
followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls
that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to
be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the
Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty
corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the
classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons,
where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as
possible to their hot cauldrons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class,
“for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because
they’re not wanted at home.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle
chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored
them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch
match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone
laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker
next. Then he’d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so
impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So
Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no
proper family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for
Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list
of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at
once. He didn’t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best
Christmas he’d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr.
and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they
found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking
out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his head
through the branches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold
drawl from behind them. “Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping
to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose—that hut of
Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“WEASLEY!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking
his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. “Malfoy was insultin’ his
family.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules,
Hagrid,” said Snape silkily. “Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be
grateful it isn’t more. Move along, all of you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree,
scattering needles everywhere and smirking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s
back, “one of these days, I’ll get him—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid.
“Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the
Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with
the Christmas decorations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree—put it in the far corner, would
you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe
hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees
stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with
hundreds of candles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” Hagrid
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me—Harry, Ron,
we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away
from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and
was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the hall.
“Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. “Ever
since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You <i>what?”</i>  Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here—I’ve
told yeh—drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,”
said Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?”
Harry added. “We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t
find him anywhere—just give us a hint—I know I’ve read his name somewhere.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, and
they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever
since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what
Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to
begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He
wasn’t in <i>Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century,</i>  or <i>Notable Magical
Names of Our Time;</i>  he was missing, too, from <i>Important Modern Magical
Discoveries,</i>  and <i>A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry.</i>  And
then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of
books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had
decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling
them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section.
He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there.
Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to
look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he’d never get one. These were
the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only
read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What are you looking for, boy?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nothing,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’d better get out, then. Go on—out!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story,
Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they’d better
not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she’d be able
to tell them, but they couldn’t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two
had found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. They had been looking for two
weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t
surprising they’d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search
without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking
their heads. They went off to lunch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said
Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find anything.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,”
said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too
good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves
and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the
good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could
spear on a toasting fork—bread, English muffins, marshmallows—and plotting ways
of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t
work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was
exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a
lot like directing troops in battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like
everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family—in
this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all.
Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and
they didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a very good player yet and they kept
shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. “Don’t send me
there, can’t you see his knight? Send <i>him,</i>  we can afford to lose <i>him.”</i>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the
next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When
he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile
of packages at the foot of his bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out
of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got
some presents!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to his own
pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick
brown paper and scrawled across it was <i>To Harry, from Hagrid.</i>  Inside
was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry
blew it—it sounded a bit like an owl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A second, very small parcel contained a note.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>We received your message and enclose
your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Taped to the note was a fifty pence piece.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s friendly,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Weird!”</i>  he said, “What a shape! This is <i>money?”</i>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron
was. “Hagrid and my aunt and uncle—so who sent these?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a
bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t
expect any presents and—oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you a Weasley
sweater.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand knitted
sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping
his own, “and mine’s <i>always</i>  maroon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the fudge,
which was very tasty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His next present also contained candy—a large box of
Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it.
It was very light. He unwrapped it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the
floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping
the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione. “If that’s what I
think it is—they’re really rare, and <i>really</i>  valuable.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What is it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It
was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his
face. “I’m sure it is—try it on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a
yell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It <i>is!</i>  Look down!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed
to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head
suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over
his head and his reflection vanished completely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of
it!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in
narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Your father left this in my
possession before he died.</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>It is time it was returned to you.</i>
</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Use it well.</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>A Very Merry Christmas to you.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was
admiring the cloak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’d give <i>anything</i>  for one of these,” he said. <i>“Anything.</i> 
What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent
the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory
door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the
cloak quickly out of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else
yet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, look—Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large
yellow <i>F</i>  on it, the other a <i>G.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up
Harry’s sweater. “She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded. “Come
on, get it on, they’re lovely and warm.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it
over his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed. “I
suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. But we’re not stupid—we know
we’re called Gred and Forge.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s all this noise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking
disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as
he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“P</i>  for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all
wearing ours, even Harry got one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I—don’t—want,” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the
sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, either,”
said George. “Christmas is a time for family.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to
his side by his sweater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner.
A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters
of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and
cranberry sauce—and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table.
These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the
Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper
hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang,
it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue
smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live,
white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard’s
hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor
Flitwick had just read him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly
broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid
getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally
kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled
and blushed, her top hat lopsided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a
stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable,
luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.
The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to
end up as Mrs. Norris’s Christmas dinner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a
furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath,
they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in
his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have
lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and
Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except
sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because
they’d stolen his prefect badge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet something
had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed
was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to
bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of his four
poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from
under it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His father’s… this had been his father’s. He let the
material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. <i>Use it well,</i> 
the note had said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the
cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and
shadows. It was a very funny feeling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Use it well.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was
open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in
the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would
never know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something
held him back—his father’s cloak—he felt that this time—the first time—he
wanted to use it alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the
common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He
walked quickly down the corridor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and
thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He’d
be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel
was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The library was pitch black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp
to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating
along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the
sight gave him the creeps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library.
Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of
the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters
spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t understand. Some had no title at all.
One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on
the back of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he
thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone
was there who shouldn’t be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully
on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book.
A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with
difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it
fall open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence—the book
was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high,
unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp,
which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor
outside—stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed
Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and
Harry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor,
the book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor.
He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn’t paid attention to
where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t recognize where he
was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must
be five floors above there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone
was wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library Restricted
Section.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was,
Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer,
and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well,
they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came
around the corner ahead. They couldn’t see him, of course, but it was a narrow
corridor and if they came much nearer they’d knock right into him—the cloak
didn’t stop him from being solid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to
his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath,
trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room
without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned
against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away.
That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed
anything about the room he had hidden in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks
and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper
basket—but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look
as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it
there to keep it out of the way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an
ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved
around the top: <i>Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.</i>  His panic
fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to
the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped
in front of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from
screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than
when the book had screamed—for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but
a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty.
Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There he was, reflected in it, white and scared looking, and
there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his
shoulder—but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he
in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror’s trick was that it
reflected them, invisible or not?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind
his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt
the air behind him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections
were so close together, but he felt only air—she and the others existed only in
the mirror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her
eyes—<i>her eyes are just like mine,</i>  Harry thought, edging a little closer
to the glass. Bright green—exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she
was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black haired
man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair
was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was
nearly touching that of his reflection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked
into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green
eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though
he had Harry’s knobbly knees—Harry was looking at his family, for the first
time in his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily
back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping
to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside
him, half joy, half terrible sadness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How long he stood there, he didn’t know. The reflections did
not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his
senses. He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his
eyes away from his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from
the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you
the mirror.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll
be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round
my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not
finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren’t you eating
anything?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and would be
seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem
very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What
did it matter if Snape stole it, really?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find
the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk
much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from the
library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“No!”</i>  Harry hissed. I know it’s here somewhere.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the
opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his
feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s here—just here—yes!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from
around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight
of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“See?” Harry whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I can’t see anything.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look! Look at them all… there are loads of them…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I can only see you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he
couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look at me!” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can you see all your family standing around you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No—I’m alone—but I’m different—I look older—and I’m head
boy!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“What?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I am—I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to—and I’m
holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup—I’m Quidditch captain, too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look
excitedly at Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you think this mirror shows the future?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How can it? All my family are dead—let me have another
look—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more
time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’re only holding the Quidditch cup, what’s interesting
about that? I want to see my parents.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t push me—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their
discussion. They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Quick!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of
Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking
the same thing—did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned
and left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This isn’t safe—she might have gone for Filch, I bet she
heard us. Come on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No… you go…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror.
Don’t go back tonight.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why not?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it—and anyway,
you’ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are
wandering around. So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into you?
What if you knock something over?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You sound like Hermione.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get
back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That third night he found his way more quickly than before.
He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he
didn’t meet anyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And there were his mother and father smiling at him again,
and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the
floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here
all night with his family. Nothing at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Except—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So—back again, Harry?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He
looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than
Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get
to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“—I didn’t see you, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said
Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the
floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It—well—it shows me my family—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How did you know—?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore
gently. “Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry shook his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to
use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it
and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we
want… whatever we want…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing
more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who
have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who
has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the
best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or
truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or
been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and
I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you
will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,
remember that. Now, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off
to bed?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry stood up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sir—Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You
may ask me one more thing, however.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry stared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another
Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist
on giving me books.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry
that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he
shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>13. NICOLAS FLAMEL</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the
Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the
Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he
could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He
started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents
disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with
laughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you
mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a
different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry
being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had
caught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at least found out who Nicolas
Flamel was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a
library book, even though Harry was still sure he’d read the name somewhere.
Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes
during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because
Quidditch practice had started again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless
rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys
complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood’s side. If
they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in
the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from
wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out
after training.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice
session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d just gotten very angry with
the Weasleys, who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their
brooms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s exactly
the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match! Snape’s refereeing this time, and
he’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Snape’s</i>  refereeing?” he spluttered through a
mouthful of mud. “When’s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He’s not going to
be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s not <i>my</i>  fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to
make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another
reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as
usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor
common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only
thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for
her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat
down next to him, “I need to concen—” He caught sight of Harry’s face. “What’s
the matter with you? You look terrible.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told
the other two about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Really</i>  break your leg,” said Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I
back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he
had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his
legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg
Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up
and performed the countercurse. Neville’s legs sprang apart and he got to his
feet, trembling. “What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit
with Harry and Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the
library. He said he’d been looking for someone to practice that on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville.
“Report him!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neville shook his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. “He’s
used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of
him and make it easier.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in
Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville choked out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a
Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for
Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Sorting
Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And where’s Malfoy? In stinking
Slytherin.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the
frog.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thanks, Harry… I think I’ll go to bed… D’you want the card,
you collect them, don’t you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard
card.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked
up at Ron and Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“I’ve found him!”</i>  he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel!
I <i>told</i>  you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train
coming here—listen to this: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat
of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of
dragon’s blood, <i>and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’!”</i>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so excited
since they’d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to
the girls’ dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified
looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly.
“I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Light?”</i>  said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet
until she’d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the
pages, muttering to herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At last she found what she was looking for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I knew it! I <i>knew</i>  it!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione
ignored him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, <i>“is the
only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone!”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The what?” said Harry and Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, <i>honestly,</i>  don’t you two read? Look—read that,
there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'>The ancient study of alchemy is
concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with
astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also
produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'>There have been many reports of the
Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel,
who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year, enjoys a
quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty eight).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The
dog must be guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to
keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it,
that’s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!”
said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! <i>Anyone</i>  would want it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that <i>Study of
Recent Developments in Wizardry,”</i>  said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if
he’s six hundred and sixty five, is he?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while
copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were
still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It
wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered
about Snape and the coming match.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t,
all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show
them… it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said
Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and
more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t
too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship
was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed
to, with such a biased referee?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he
seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered
whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions
lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to
Harry. Could Snape possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone?
Harry didn’t see how he could—yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that
Snape could read minds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the
locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether
they’d ever see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call comforting. Harry
hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and
picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands
next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried,
or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know
that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg Locker Curse. They’d
gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on
Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now, don’t forget, it’s <i>Locomotor Mortis,”</i>  Hermione
muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an
early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor
Hufflepuff too much.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering
out of the door. “Even—blimey—Dumbledore’s come to watch!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry’s heart did a somersault.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Dumbledore?”</i>  he said, dashing to the door to make
sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry could have laughed out loud with relief—He was safe.
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore
was watching.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams
marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told Hermione.
“Look they’re off—Ouch!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was
Malfoy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom this
time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a
penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all
her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was
circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor
team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff
another penalty for no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for. See,
there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no
money—you should be on the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face
Malfoy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron,
still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him, Neville.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than
Weasley, and that’s saying something.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point
with anxiety about Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m warning you, Malfoy—one more word—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What? Where?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew
gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her
mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted some
money on the ground!” said Malfoy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was
on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered
over the back of his seat to help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat
to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape—she didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron
rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl
of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time
to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches—the next second,
Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped
in his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever
remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s won!
We’ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down
on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He
couldn’t believe it. He’d done it—the game was over; it had barely lasted five
minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby,
white faced and tight lipped—then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked
up into Dumbledore’s smiling face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry
could hear. “Nice to see you haven’t been brooding about that mirror… been
keeping busy… excellent…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Snape spat bitterly on the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take
his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn’t ever remember
feeling happier. He’d really done something to be proud of now—no one could say
he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet.
He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a
happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and
Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy
nosebleed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden
door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting
sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He’d done it, he’d shown Snape…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And speaking of Snape…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the
castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward
the forbidden forest. Harry’s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He
recognized the figure’s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while
everyone else was at dinner—what was going on?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off.
Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He
followed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape had
gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees
until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a
towering beech tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding
tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn’t
alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t make out the look on his face,
but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were
saying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“…d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all
p-places, Severus…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his
voice icy. “Students aren’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer’s Stone, after
all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape
interrupted him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s
yet?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“B-b-but Severus, I—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said Snape,
taking a step toward him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I—I don’t know what you—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know perfectly well what I mean.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree.
He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, “—your little bit of hocus
pocus. I’m waiting.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“B-but I d-d-don’t—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Very well,” Snape cut in. “We’ll have another little chat
soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your
loyalties lie.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the
clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite
still as though he was petrified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<h6>* * *</h6>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Harry, where have you <i>been?”</i>  Hermione squeaked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on
the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe
and Goyle single handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he’ll be
all right—talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone’s waiting for you in the
common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff
from the kitchens.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s find
an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door
behind them, then he told them what he’d seen and heard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So we were right, it <i>is</i>  the Sorcerer’s Stone, and
Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to
get past Fluffy—and he said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus pocuss’—I reckon
there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of
enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti Dark Arts spell
that Snape needs to break through—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell
stands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>14. NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d
thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and
thinner, but it didn’t look as though he’d cracked yet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every time they passed the third floor corridor, Harry, Ron,
and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still
growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely
meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days
he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people
off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer’s
Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her
notes. Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the
same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hermione, the exams are ages away.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, that’s like
a second to Nicolas Flamel.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded her.
“Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it’s an A.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need
to pass these exams to get into the second year? They’re very important, I should
have started studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into me…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the
same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter
holidays weren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax
with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or
practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of
their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra
work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one afternoon,
throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was
the first really fine day they’d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget me
not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in <i>One Thousand
Magical Herbs and Fungi,</i>  didn’t look up until he heard Ron say, “Hagrid!
What are you doing in the library?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back.
He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their
interest at once. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He looked suddenly suspicious.
“Yer not still lookin’ fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron
impressively. “And we know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a Sorcerer’s St—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shhhh!” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was
listening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of
fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen—come an’ see me later,
I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in
here, students aren’ s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“See you later, then,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid shuffled off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What was he hiding behind his back?” said Hermione
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m going to see what section he was in,” said Ron, who’d
had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his
arms and slammed them down on the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Dragons!” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff about
dragons! Look at these: <i>Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From
Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first
time I ever met him,” said Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon breeding was
outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to
stop Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in the back
garden—anyway, you can’t tame dragons, it’s dangerous. You should see the burns
Charlie’s got off wild ones in Romania.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But there aren’t wild dragons in <i>Britain?”</i>  said
Harry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh Green and
Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell
you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted them, to
make them forget.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what on earths Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an
hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed.
Hagrid called “Who is it?” before he let them in, and then shut the door
quickly behind them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm
day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered
them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So—yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around the
bush. “We were wondering if you could tell us what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s
Stone apart from Fluffy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid frowned at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“O’ course I can’t,” he said. “Number one, I don’ know
meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I
could. That Stone’s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta
Gringotts—I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how yeh even know
abou’ Fluffy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you
<i>do</i>  know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in
a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid’s beard twitched and they could tell he was
smiling. “We only wondered who had <i>done</i>  the guarding, really.” Hermione
went on. “We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from
you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron
beamed at Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that… let’s
see… he borrowed Fluffy from me… then some o’ the teachers did enchantments…
Professor Sprout—Professor Flitwick—Professor McGonagall—” he ticked them off
on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell—an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’
course. Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Snape?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah—yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape
helped <i>protect</i>  the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he
was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to
find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew
everything—except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy,
aren’t you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. “And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would
you? Not even one of the teachers?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said Hagrid
proudly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others.
“Hagrid, can we have a window open? I’m boiling.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance
at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hagrid—what’s <i>that?”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the
fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard,
“That’s er…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the
fire to get a closer look at the egg. “It must’ve cost you a fortune.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the
village havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger. Think
he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched?”
said Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling a
large book from under his pillow. “Got this outta the library—<i>Dragon
Breeding for Pleasure and Profit</i> —it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but
it’s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe on I
em, see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’ brandy mixed with chicken
blood every half hour. An’ see here—how ter recognize diff’rent eggs—what I got
there’s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They’re rare, them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hagrid, you live in a <i>wooden house,”</i>  she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily as he
stoked the fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So now they had something else to worry about: what might
happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his
hut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed,
as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they
were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and
Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note
from Hagrid. He had written only two words: <i>It’s hatching.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the
hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a
dragon hatching?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s
nothing to what Hagrid’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s
doing—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shut up!” Harry whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to
listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at
all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the
end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning
break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the
three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to
the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in
it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with
bated breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split
open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry
thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge
compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the
stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Isn’t he <i>beautiful?”</i>  Hagrid murmured. He reached
out a hand to stroke the dragon’s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing
pointed fangs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks
grow, exactly?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained
from his face—he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains—it’s a
kid—he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance
there was no mistaking him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy had seen the dragon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during
the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of
their free time in Hagrid’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in
length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn’t
been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy.
There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at
the dragon with misty eyes. “He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert!
Where’s Mommy?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and
Norbert’s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at
any moment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid bit his lip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I—I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump
him, I can’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry suddenly turned to Ron. “Charlie,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, remember?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No—Charlie—your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying
dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then
put him back in the wild!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to
Charlie to ask him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found
Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else
had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the
portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s
Invisibility Cloak. He had been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed Norbert,
who was now eating dead rats by the crate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was
wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. “I’m not going to be able to hold a quill for
a week. I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but
the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny
rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he
was singing it a lullaby.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a tap on the dark window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let her in. “She’ll
have Charlie’s answer!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The three of them put their heads together to read the note.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Dear Ron,</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>How are you? Thanks for the
letter—I’d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won’t be easy
getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some
friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn’t be
seen carrying an illegal dragon.</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Could you get the Ridgeback up the
tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him
away while it’s still dark.</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Send me an answer as soon as
possible.</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Love,</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Charlie</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They looked at one another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It
shouldn’t be too difficult—I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and
Norbert.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the
other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert—and Malfoy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten hand
had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn’t know whether it was safe to go
to Madam Pomfrey—would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though,
he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if
Norbert’s fangs were poisonous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end
of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that feels like
it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my
books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell
her what really bit me—I’ve told her it was a dog, but I don’t think she
believes me. I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s why he’s
doing this.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione,
but this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke
into a sweat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. “Oh no—oh
no—I’ve just remembered—Charlie’s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s
going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. Madam
Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione.
“We haven’t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only
chance to get rid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we <i>have</i>  got
the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a
bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky
stage—nothin’ I can’t handle.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they told him about Charlie’s letter, his eyes filled
with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him
on the leg.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot—jus’ playin’—he’s
only a baby, after all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows
rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t
come quickly enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for
him to say good bye to Norbert if they hadn’t been so worried about what they
had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving
at Hagrid’s hut because they’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way
in the entrance hall, where he’d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid
had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,”
said Hagrid in a muffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets
lonely.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to
Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bye bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione
covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it
themselves. “Mommy will never forget you!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle,
they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble
staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another
staircase, then another—even one of Harry’s shortcuts didn’t make the work much
easier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the corridor
beneath the tallest tower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop
the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the
shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other
ten feet away. A lamp flared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net,
had Malfoy by the ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from Slytherin!
Wandering around in the middle of the night, how <i>dare</i>  you—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s coming—he’s
got a dragon!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on—I
shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed
the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out into
the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe
properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t,” Harry advised her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about
in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out
of the darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Charlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and
Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between
them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione
shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At last, Norbert was going… going… <i>gone.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as
light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon—Malfoy in
detention—what could spoil their happiness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As
they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the
darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we <i>are</i>  in
trouble.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>15. THE FORBIDDEN FOREST</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Things couldn’t have been worse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the
first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other.
Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each
other around Harry’s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn’t see how
they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could
they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth
that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping
around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest
astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and
the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse? He
was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two.
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to
catch you, he said you had a drag—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but
Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than
Norbert as she towered over the three of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch
says you were up in the astronomy tower. It’s one o’clock in the morning. <i>Explain
yourselves.”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a
teacher’s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said
Professor McGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco
Malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed
and into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose you think it’s funny that
Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him without
words that this wasn’t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt.
Poor, blundering Neville—Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find
them in the dark, to warn them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four students
out of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss
Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought
Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive
detentions—yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, <i>nothing</i>  gives you the right to
walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous—and
fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Fifty?”</i>  Harry gasped—they would lose the lead, the
lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fifty points <i>each,”</i>  said Professor McGonagall,
breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Professor—please—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You <i>can’t—”</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get back
to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last
place. In one night, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house
cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could
they ever make up for this?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing
into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn’t think of anything to
say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What
would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that
recorded the house points the next day thought there’d been a mistake. How
could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And
then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their
hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple
of other stupid first years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From being one of the most popular and admired people at the
school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs
turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the
house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower
their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he
walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Thanks, Potter, we owe you one!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only Ron stood by him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George
have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still
like them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go,
though, have they?” said Harry miserably.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well—no,” Ron admitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to
himself not to meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had
it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went
to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Resign?”</i>  Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How
are we going to get any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team
wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him,
they called him “the Seeker.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t have
as bad a time as Harry, because they weren’t as well known, but nobody would
speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in
class, keeping her head down and working in silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away. All
the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione
kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the
ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize
the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, about a week before the exams were due to start,
Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was
put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one
afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew
closer, he heard Quirrell’s voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No—no—not again, please—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry
moved closer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right—all right—” he heard Quirrell sob.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom
straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry.
He strode out of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He
waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the
classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was
halfway toward it before he remembered what he’d promised himself about not
meddling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones
that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape
would be walking with a new spring in his step—Quirrell seemed to have given in
at last.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing
Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him
how to break his Anti Dark Force spell—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking
Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I
bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three
headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but
Hermione answered before Harry could.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago.
If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But we’ve got no <i>proof!”</i>  said Harry. “Quirrell’s
too scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll
got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor—who do you
think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him,
Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if
his life depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students
get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not supposed
to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If we just do a bit of poking around—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn
the names of its moons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry,
Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Your detention will take place at
eleven o’clock tonight.</i> </p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.</i>
</p>

<p class=Cite style='text-indent:1.0cm'><i>Professor McGonagall</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the
furor over the points they’d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that
this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Harry,
she felt they deserved what they’d got.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At eleven o’clock that night, they said good bye to Ron in
the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was
already there—and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had
gotten a detention, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them
outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule
again, won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh yes… hard work and pain
are the best teachers if you ask me… It’s just a pity they let the old
punishments die out… hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days,
I’ve got the chains still in my office, keep ’em well oiled in case they’re
ever needed… Right, off we go, and don’t think of running off, now, it’ll be
worse for you if you do.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept
sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be
something really horrible, or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept
throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of
Hagrid’s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working with
Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because
Filch said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf?
Well, think again, boy—it’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken
if you’ll all come out in one piece.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped
dead in his tracks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite as cool
as usual. “We can’t go in there at night—there’s all sorts of things in
there—werewolves, I heard.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a
choking noise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice
cracking with glee. “Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in
trouble, shouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at
his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over
his shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour
already. All right, Harry, Hermione?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said Filch
coldly, “they’re here to be punished, after all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at
Filch. “Bin lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do that. Yeh’ve done yer
bit, I’ll take over from here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of
them,” he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his
lamp bobbing away in the darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was
pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid
fiercely. “Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I
thought we’d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this,
he’d—”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“—tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid growled.
“Copyin’ lines! What good’s that ter anyone? Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll
get out. If yeh think yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back off
ter the castle an’ pack. Go on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then
dropped his gaze.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ’cause
it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’
risks. Follow me over here a moment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp
up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into
the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the
forest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the
ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin
hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last
Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have ter put it
out of its misery.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” said
Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh
if yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the path. Right, now, we’re
gonna split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions.
There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last
night at least.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long
teeth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. “So
me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the
other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right?
Get yer wands out an’ practice now—that’s it—an’ if anyone gets in trouble,
send up red sparks, an’ we’ll all come an’ find yeh—so, be careful—let’s go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they
reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left
path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now
and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver
blue blood on the fallen leaves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Could</i>  a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch a
unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt
before.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear
running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still
spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ worry, it
can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then we’ll be able ter—GET
BEHIND THAT TREE!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the
path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his
crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was
slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the
ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the
sound faded away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here that shouldn’
be.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A werewolf?” Harry suggested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, neither,”
said Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but careful, now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest
sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself—I’m armed!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And into the clearing came—was it a man, or a horse? To the
waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse’s gleaming
chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are yeh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a deep,
sorrowful voice. “Were you going to shoot me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his
crossbow. “There’s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an’
Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan, you
two. He’s a centaur.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are
you? And do you learn much, up at the school?”</span></p>
